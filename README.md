Pseudo Code:

- 


Time complexities:

- toggle:
- switchToMax & switchToMin: In the best case scenario, these methods are applied on a heap that is already of the desired type. 
                             In that case, they would be of constant time O(1). 
                             On the other hand, in the worst case scenario, they have to be converted to an heap of the opposite type.
                             In that case, these two methods are the equivalent of a toggle(). Therefore, they are of O(n) type.
